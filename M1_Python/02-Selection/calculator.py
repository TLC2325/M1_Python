# PART 2

# Inputs two numbers (int or float, your choice) Tip: Use two input() statements. Don't forget to cast the text to either int or float.

# 10- Display a typical calculator menu such as Tip: Use simple print() statements

# 11- Ask the user to choose what operation to perform. For example if they select + then you should display the sum of the two numbers. Tip: Use input() statements. There is no need to cast the text. You'll need a single ifâ€¦elif statement to examine the operator and display the result.

# 12- Save and run.
